    "In this investigation, we will predict the total hours played by players according to the players.csv dataset. In the study led by Frank Wood, players’ actions and profiles were observed on a Minecraft server. One of the research's key challenges is predicting which types of players are likely to generate large amounts of gameplay data. This information would allow them to target recruitment more effectively and plan the necessary computing resources to operate the server. For the purpose of this report, we will see if the data describing each player in players.csv, which includes 196 observations and 7 variables: (experience, subscription, “hashedEmail,” played hours, name, gender, and age), can predict the total hours played by a player. Below is a summary of the players.csv data set:"

    "To begin exploring our question, we wanted to choose predictor variables based on those we inferred would have the most impact on predicting the total hours played. We selected gender and age, because they are variables that capture basic demographic differences that may affect gaming habits, including how much they play and how long they stay active on the server. These variables are commonly used in behavioural data analysis, and they offer a straightforward starting point for understanding what types of players may spend more time on the server. By grouping age into categories and treating gender as a factor, we ensured the predictors fit naturally into a regression model. This narrowed down our question to: ***Can the variables of gender and age group be used to predict the total hours played by a player?***\n",
    "Because we wanted to predict a numerical value, hours_played, using different types of variables, we decided to use linear regression as our method of prediction. This is also helpful because the data set is relatively small, and linear regression offers a clear and transparent way to understand how each of these variables will contribute to predicting hours played."

    "### Discussion\n",
    "The goal of this investigation was to determine whether a player’s age and gender could be used to predict the total number of hours they played on a Minecraft research server. After cleaning and exploring the dataset, we built a linear regression model using these two predictors. The results showed that the model performed poorly, with a RMSE of ~ 29.6 hours and a higher RMSPE of ~ 52.2 hours. These error values indicate that the model’s predictions were often far from the true number of hours played. Additionally, none of the predictors showed strong or consistent relationships with the outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results were largely expected. Before running the model, we did not anticipate that age or gender would be strong predictors of gaming activity based on our exploratory visualizations. Our EDA plots showed only weak and inconsistent trends between played hours and both age group and gender. The bar plot of average played hours across age groups showed no clear increasing or decreasing trend, the bar plot comparing genders showed irregularity among groups, and the line plot showed no stable or predictable relationship between demographics and playtime. These observations suggested that neither predictor was strongly correlated with total hours played. Additionally, total hours played is a highly individual behaviour influenced by many complex factors that are not present in the initial dataset to begin with, such as motivation to play, how much free time a player has, or personal interest. Because our predictors captured only basic demographics, it was reasonable to expect that the model would not be able to explain much of the variation in played hours. The large differences in playtime between users also made it difficult for a simple model to accurately estimate individual values.\n",
    "\n",
    "The findings suggest that demographic information alone is not sufficient for understanding or predicting player engagement on this server. For researchers or game designers aiming to target recruitment or allocate computing resources more efficiently, this means that more meaningful behavioural data is likely needed. Variables such as login frequency, time of day, or in-game actions would probably yield better insights than demographics alone. Our model’s weak performance highlights the importance of collecting richer, activity-based predictors when trying to estimate player behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "This analysis raises several questions that could guide future work. One direction would be to investigate which behaviour based variables correlate most strongly with played hours. Another question is whether different types of players (e.g., beginner vs. experienced) follow different patterns that would require separate models. Additionally, exploring non-linear models or models that incorporate more detailed timebased features might lead to more accurate predictions. Expanding the dataset to include more diverse or detailed variables could help build a stronger understanding of what drives players to be more highly active on the server."
