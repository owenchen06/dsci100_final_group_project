    "In this investigation, we will predict the total hours played by players according to the player.csv dataset. In the study led by Frank Wood, players’ actions and profiles were observed on a Minecraft server. For the purpose of this report, we will see if the data describing each player in players.csv includes 196 observations and 7 variables: (experience, subscription, “hashedEmail,” played hours, name, gender, and age)   can predict the total hours played; specifically, using the gender, age, subscription and experience.\n"
